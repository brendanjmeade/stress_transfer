Todo:

- Convert ProcessSrcmod.m (Matlab) to ProcessSrcmod.py (Python)

- Python script to look at all SRCMOD files in current director and plot locations on the globe
  - Download at least two geographically different SRCMOD files
  - Find Mai's documentation on reference frames
  - Convert from UTM (?) to global longitude and latitude
     - evLON: -116.4300 (longitude degrees)
     - evLAT: 34.2000 (latitude, degrees)
     - evDPT: 7 (depth, km?)
     - The geometrical representation uses the top-center of each fault segment and each subfault as reference; latitude, longitude and depth for each segment/subfault are provided as well as X (EW, positive toward E) and Y (NS, positive toward N) coordinates with origin at the epicenter, computed using UTM-coordinates based on the UTM-zone of the epicenter. Hence, geometrical biases or small deviations from other sources or published images may occur if the epicenter is located close to a border of an UTM zone.
